# Diabetic Patient Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Diabetic Patient Data Analysis** project! This
repository explores, processes, and analyzes diabetic patient data
using machine learning techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful
insights and predictions to better understand diabetes-related trends
and outcomes.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of diabetic patient data to
assist in research and potential medical advancements. By utilizing
machine learning and data visualization, we aim to:

- **Identify patterns** in diabetic patient data.
- **Predict outcomes** using machine learning models.
- **Visualize trends** to enhance understanding of the data.

## What's Inside?
This repository includes the following:

- **Data preprocessing scripts** to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and patterns
in the data.
- **Machine learning models** to predict outcomes based on patient metrics.
- **Visualization scripts** to present findings in an intuitive manner.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas and NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gholinasabmaryam/Diabetic-patient-data-analysis.git
   cd Diabetic-patient-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the scripts:**
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE to run the analysis and
model training scripts.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive EDA:** Gain insights into the dataset through
descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Train machine learning models to predict
diabetic patient outcomes.
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values
and outliers.

## Future Work
- Add advanced machine learning algorithms for improved prediction.
- Integrate deep learning models for more complex analysis.
- Explore real-time prediction capabilities.
